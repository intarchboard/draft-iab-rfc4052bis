1.  Liaison Relationships and Personnel

   The IETF, as an organization, has the need to engage in direct
   communication or joint endeavors with various other formal
   organizations.  For example, the IETF is one of several Standards
   Development Organizations, or SDOs, and all SDOs including the IETF
   find it increasingly necessary to communicate and coordinate their
   activities involving Internet-related technologies.  This is useful
   in order to avoid overlap in work efforts and to manage interactions
   between their groups.  In cases where the mutual effort to
   communicate and coordinate activities is formalized, these
   relationships are generically referred to as "liaison relationships".

   In such cases, a person from the IETF is designated to manage a given
   liaison relationship; that person is generally called the "IETF
   liaison manager" to the other organization.  When the liaison
   relationship is expected to encompass a complex or broad range of
   activities, more people may be designated to undertake some portions
   of the communications, coordinated by the liaison manager.  Often,
   the other organization will similarly designate their own liaison
   manager to the IETF.

   This document is chiefly concerned with: - the establishment and
   maintenance of liaison relationships, and - the appointment and
   responsibilities of IETF liaison managers and representatives.

   The management of other organizations' liaison managers to the IETF,
   whether or not in the context of a liaison relationship, is outside
   the scope of this document.

   The IETF has chartered the Internet Architecture Board to manage
   liaison relationships.  Consistent with its charter [BCP39], the IAB
   acts as representative of the interests of the IETF in technical
   liaison relationships with other organizations concerned with
   standards and other technical and organizational issues relevant to
   the worldwide Internet.  Liaison relationships are kept as informal
   as possible and must be of demonstrable value to the IETF's technical
   mandate.  Individual participants of the IETF are appointed as
   liaison managers or representatives to other organizations by the
   IAB.

   In general, a liaison relationship is most valuable when there are
   areas of technical development of mutual interest.  For the most
   part, SDOs would rather leverage existing work done by other
   organizations than recreate it themselves (and would like the same
   done with respect to their own work).  Establishing a liaison
   relationship can provide the framework for ongoing communications to
   - prevent inadvertent duplication of effort, without obstructing
   either organization from pursuing its own mandate; - provide
   authoritative information of one organization's dependencies on the
   other's work.

2.  Aspects of Liaisons and Liaison Management

2.1.  Liaison Relationships

   A liaison relationship is set up when it is mutually agreeable and
   needed for some specific purpose, in the view of the other
   organization, the IAB, and the IETF participants conducting the work.
   There is no set process or form for this; the IETF participants and
   the peer organization approach the IAB, and after discussion come to
   an agreement to form the relationship.  In some cases, the intended
   scope and guidelines for the collaboration are documented
   specifically (e.g., see [RFC3113], [RFC3131], and [RFC3356]).

   In setting up the relationship, the IAB expects that there will be a
   mutual exchange of views and discussion of the best approach for
   undertaking new standardization work items.  Any work items resulting
   for the IETF will be undertaken in the usual IETF procedures, defined
   in [BCP9].  The peer organization often has different organizational
   structure and procedures than the IETF, which will require some
   flexibility on the part of both organizations to accommodate.  The
   IAB expects that each organization will use the relationship
   carefully, allowing time for the processes it requests to occur in
   the other organization, and will not make unreasonable demands.

2.2.  Liaison Manager

   As described above, most work on mutually interesting topics will be
   carried out in the usual way within the IETF and the peer
   organization.  Therefore, most communications will be informal in
   nature (for example, Working Group (WG) or mailing list discussions).

   An important function of the liaison manager is to ensure that
   communication is maintained, productive, and timely.  He or she may
   use any applicable businesslike approach, from private to public
   communications, and bring in other parties as needed.  If a
   communication from a peer organization is addressed to an
   inappropriate party, such as being sent to the WG but not copying the
   Area Director (AD) or being sent to the wrong WG, the liaison manager
   will help redirect or otherwise augment the communication.

   IETF liaison managers should also communicate and coordinate with
   other liaison managers where concerned technical activities overlap.

   Since the IAB is ultimately responsible for liaison relationships,
   anyone who has a problem with a relationship (whether an IETF
   participant or a person from the peer organization) should first
   consult the IAB's designated liaison manager, and if that does not
   result in a satisfactory outcome, the IAB itself.

2.3.  Liaison Representatives

   The liaison manager is, specifically, a representative of the IETF
   for the purpose of managing the liaison relationship.  There may be
   occasion to identify other representatives for the same relationship.
   For example, if the area of mutual work is extensive, it might be
   appropriate to name several people as liaison representatives to
   different parts of the other organization.  Or, it might be
   appropriate to name a liaison representative to attend a particular
   meeting.

   These other liaison representatives are selected by the IAB and work
   in conjunction (and close communication) with the liaison manager.
   In some cases, this may also require communication and coordination
   with other liaison managers or representatives where concerned
   technical activities overlap.  The specific responsibilities of the
   liaison representative will be identified at the time of appointment.

2.4.  Liaison Communications

   Communications between organizations use a variety of formal and
   informal channels.  The stated preference of the IETF, which is
   largely an informal organization, is to use informal channels, as
   these have historically worked well to expedite matters.  In some
   cases, however, a more formal communication is appropriate, either as
   an adjunct to the informal channel or in its place.  In the case of
   formal communications, the established procedures of many
   organizations use a form known as a "liaison statement".  Procedures
   for sending, managing, and responding to liaison statements are
   discussed in [RFC4053].

3.  Summary of IETF Liaison Manager Responsibilities

   The main responsibility of the liaison manager is to ensure good and
   formally correct communication between the organisations.  This often
   includes:

   *  Ensure received LSs are recorded and delivered to the relevant
      groups.

   *  Ensure replies are sent in time or it is appropriately
      communicated why a reply is delayed or not sent.

   *  Ensure liaison statements from the IETF adhere to the formal
      requirements of the peer organization (e.g. formatting) and are
      delivered to the appropriate groups.

   *  Provide additional communication on e.g. process or known
      consensus positions in the IETF.  This may also require to
      participate in relevant meetings of the peer organisation and
      potentially report back to the appropriate IETF organization any
      material information that is intended to be shared by the peer
      organisation.

   Formal messages from the IETF to the peer organization are usually
   carried in liaison statements.  In certain situations the liaison
   manager may carry addional messages, when specifically instructed.
   However, if these communications aim to "represent the IETF", they
   must have consensus, e.g. by being based on an RFC or some other
   formal statement by a group within the IETF.

   Optionally liaison manager may provide updates to the IAB on
   technical matters.  Especially if a concern e.g. regarding technical
   overlap or correctness is detected this should be communicated to the
   IAB.  However, given most organization are quite large, it is not
   expected that the liaison manager can have the full overview about
   everything that is going on.
