--- abstract

This document discusses the procedures used by the IAB to establish
and maintain liaison relationships between the IETF and other
Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), consortia and industry
fora.  This document also discusses the appointment and
responsibilities of IETF liaison managers and representatives, and
the expectations of the IAB for organizations with whom liaison
relationships are established.

# Liaison Relationships and Personnel

The IETF, as an organization, has the need to engage in direct
communication or joint endeavors with various other formal
organizations.  For example, the IETF is one of several Standards
Development Organizations, or SDOs, and all SDOs including the IETF
find it increasingly necessary to communicate and coordinate their
activities involving Internet-related technologies.  This is useful
in order to avoid overlap in work efforts and to manage interactions
between their groups.  In cases where the mutual effort to
communicate and coordinate activities is formalized, these
relationships are generically referred to as "liaison relationships".

In such cases, a person from the IETF is designated to manage a given
liaison relationship; that person is generally called the "IETF
liaison manager" to the other organization.  When the liaison
relationship is expected to encompass a complex or broad range of
activities, more people may be designated to undertake some portions
of the communications, coordinated by the liaison manager.  Often,
the other organization will similarly designate their own liaison
manager to the IETF.

This document is chiefly concerned with:
- the establishment and maintenance of liaison relationships, and
- the appointment and responsibilities of IETF liaison managers and representatives.

The management of other organizations' liaison managers to the IETF,
whether or not in the context of a liaison relationship, is outside
the scope of this document.

The IETF has chartered the Internet Architecture Board to manage
liaison relationships.  Consistent with its charter {{!BCP39}}, the IAB acts
as representative of the interests of the IETF
in technical liaison relationships with other organizations
concerned with standards and other technical and organizational
issues relevant to the worldwide Internet.  Liaison relationships are
kept as informal as possible and must be of demonstrable value to the
IETF's technical mandate.  Individual participants of the IETF are
appointed as liaison managers or representatives to other
organizations by the IAB.

In general, a liaison relationship is most valuable when there are
areas of technical development of mutual interest.  For the most
part, SDOs would rather leverage existing work done by other
organizations than recreate it themselves (and would like the same
done with respect to their own work).  Establishing a liaison
relationship can provide the framework for ongoing communications to
- prevent inadvertent duplication of effort, without obstructing
      either organization from pursuing its own mandate;
- provide authoritative information of one organization's
      dependencies on the other's work.

# Aspects of Liaisons and Liaison Management

## Liaison Relationships

A liaison relationship is set up when it is mutually agreeable and
needed for some specific purpose, in the view of the other
organization, the IAB, and the IETF participants conducting the work.
There is no set process or form for this; the IETF participants and
the peer organization approach the IAB, and after discussion come to
an agreement to form the relationship.  In some cases, the intended
scope and guidelines for the collaboration are documented
specifically (e.g., see {{?RFC3113}}, {{?RFC3131}}, and {{?RFC3356}}).

In setting up the relationship, the IAB expects that there will be a
mutual exchange of views and discussion of the best approach for
undertaking new standardization work items.  Any work items resulting
for the IETF will be undertaken in the usual IETF procedures, defined
in {{!BCP9}}.  The peer organization often has different organizational
structure and procedures than the IETF, which will require some
flexibility on the part of both organizations to accommodate.  The
IAB expects that each organization will use the relationship
carefully, allowing time for the processes it requests to occur in
the other organization, and will not make unreasonable demands.

## Liaison Manager

As described above, most work on mutually interesting topics will be
carried out in the usual way within the IETF and the peer
organization.  Therefore, most communications will be informal in
nature (for example, Working Group (WG) or mailing list discussions).

An important function of the liaison manager is to ensure that
communication is maintained, productive, and timely.  He or she may
use any applicable businesslike approach, from private to public
communications, and bring in other parties as needed.  If a
communication from a peer organization is addressed to an
inappropriate party, such as being sent to the WG but not copying the
Area Director (AD) or being sent to the wrong WG, the liaison manager
will help redirect or otherwise augment the communication.

IETF liaison managers should also communicate and coordinate with
other liaison managers where concerned technical activities overlap.

Since the IAB is ultimately responsible for liaison relationships,
anyone who has a problem with a relationship (whether an IETF
participant or a person from the peer organization) should first
consult the IAB's designated liaison manager, and if that does not
result in a satisfactory outcome, the IAB itself.

## Liaison Representatives

The liaison manager is, specifically, a representative of the IETF
for the purpose of managing the liaison relationship.  There may be
occasion to identify other representatives for the same relationship.
For example, if the area of mutual work is extensive, it might be
appropriate to name several people as liaison representatives to
different parts of the other organization.  Or, it might be
appropriate to name a liaison representative to attend a particular
meeting.

These other liaison representatives are selected by the IAB and work
in conjunction (and close communication) with the liaison manager.
In some cases, this may also require communication and coordination
with other liaison managers or representatives where concerned
technical activities overlap.  The specific responsibilities of the
liaison representative will be identified at the time of appointment.

## Liaison Communications

Communications between organizations use a variety of formal and informal
channels irrespective of established liaison relationships. The stated
preference of the IETF, which is largely an informal organization, is to
use informal channels (e.g., discussion on expert level in specific Working
group Meeting or mailing list), as these have integrated better into IETF
process and historically worked well to expedite matters. In some cases,
however, a more formal communication is appropriate, either as an adjunct
to the informal channel or in its own place with or without liaison
relationship. In the case of formal communications, the established
procedures of many organizations use a form known as a "liaison statement".
Procedures for sending, managing, and responding to liaison statements are
discussed in {{?RFC4053}}.

Note that communications between organizations have no difference to
any other IETF contributions and should follow the same IETF process and
polices and should be open to everyone for inputs and contributions, e.g.,
input discussion in specific working group in the IETF.

# Summary of IETF Liaison Manager Responsibilities

The main responsibility of the liaison manager is to ensure good and formally correct communication between the organisations. This often includes:

- Ensure received LSs are recorded and delivered to the relevant groups.

- Ensure replies are sent in time or it is appropriately communicated why a reply is delayed or not sent.

- Ensure liaison statements from the IETF adhere to the formal requirements of the peer organization (e.g. formatting) and are delivered to the appropriate groups.

- Provide additional communication on e.g. process or known consensus positions in the IETF. This may also require to participate in relevant meetings of the peer organisation and potentially report back to the appropriate IETF organization any material information that is intended to be shared by the peer organisation.

Formal messages from the IETF to the peer organization are usually carried in liaison statements. In certain situations
the liaison manager may carry addional messages, when specifically instructed. However, if these communications aim to "represent the IETF", they must have consensus, e.g. by being based on an RFC or some other formal statement by a group within the IETF.

Optionally liaison manager may provide updates to the IAB on technical matters. Especially if a concern e.g. regarding technical overlap or correctness is detected this should be communicated to the IAB. However, given most organization are quite large, it is not expected that the liaison manager can have the full overview about everything that is going on.
