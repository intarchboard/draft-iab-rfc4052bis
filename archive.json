      "body": "Sec 3 lists responsibilities of LMs. There are effectively 6 points in random order. I think we should make it much more clear that the one main (and basically only real) responsibility is to manage a good communication between the orgs. This includes of course caring about LSs (make sure they are correctly formatted, are sent to the right place on both sides, and support people sending replies in time) but also any additional communication e.g. to communicate back informally e.g when no reply is sent or explain our process or redirect questions to the right place. This may of course require to go to the meeting in some form at least.\n\nBut I think especially the point about providing updates is more optional. Making the IAB aware of issues is part of the communication bit, but giving real updates on what's happening in the other org might not necessarily be possible as orgs like 3GPP and ITU-T are big and probably hard to follow by one person only. If the LM gives these updates it's a nice service but not a requirement on the job.\n\nAlso we have these IAB program which are usually lead by the LM and these activities can be seen as important for ensuring good communication, however, it doesn't necessarily have to be the LM that leads these program. I think it usually makes sense that way and this is also the way all these programs work right now but it could also be a different person, e.g. if a split of load is desired.\n\nFurther, it is not the responsibilities of the LM to change anything in the way liaison management works. If there is a problem, the IAB should be notified and the IAB need to address the problem (potentially of course with the help of the LM as the LM is the matter expert).\n\nAlso inline with RFC4691 we should make more clear that it is not the job of the manager to directly engage in technical discussions (rather than beginning the messenger or pointing people to existing consensus positions). Of course a LM can participate in any technical discussion in its personal capacity but the LM cannot speak for the IETF, nor has their voice any higher weight.\n\n",

Of course usually that setup makes sense but I don't think we have any such formal requirements. Maybe it's worth to write this down somewhere? However, maybe this is not the right doc or maybe we shouldn't write this in an RFC at all because IAB support groups are not a concept that is defined by any RFC?",

Arguably the biggest struggle we had (when I was involved) amounted to a misunderstanding of the relationship choices that were available, and RFC4052 really didn't spell it out well and blurred the lines between formal and informal.  Specifically:\n\n1. the document frequently used the phrase \"informal relationship\" but failed to actually define it.  Dropping an explicit reference to it means likely dropping the whole point of my rewrite: to add clarity and separation to the notions we (the IAB) really want to convey.\n2. the document flipped back and forth when talking about formal and informal relationships and formal relationships.  It would frequently talk about characteristics of an informal relationship in the middle of discussing more formal structures (see 2.2 and 2.4 of the original RFC for reference examples).\n3. In the end, without explicitly stating what an informal relationship consisted of (cross-collaboration, still able to have LSes sent, etc) we had to verbally explain it all the time rather than being able to simply state \"go see the differences between sections 2.x and 2.y.\n\nIn the end, if discussing informal relationships is beyond the scope of the document, then shouldn't all the text describing any aspect of an informal relationship be simply dropped?  Or more concretely, the word \"informal\" shouldn't even be in the document because you're only describing formal relationships (which will certainly make the document shorter!).  But, is this really helping the reader? \n\nIs the goal of the bis document to simply clarify what a formal relationship is, or is it to better explain to external organizations how to best interact with the IETF?  To me, it should really be clearly defining the interaction mechanisms available.",

          "body": "To reply concretely to your point above:\n\n1) Actually the document never used the term \"informal relationship\". It used to only talk about \"informal channels\". I fully understand your point about clarify, however, introducing a new concept of \"informal relationships\" and standing it on the same footing as a \"informal relationship\" (which is what the scope of the document is) seems to me to actually not capture it correctly because this informal relationship is not an explicit thing. In PR #48 I changes the term in your edited text to \"formal collaboration\" instead (however, missed one case...)\n\n2) This is a very good point (and my fault of writing something down out of my head without thinking very carefully about the structure) and I think your edits improve the clarity here. If you look at PR #48, it kept the text edits you did to separate things out but just not moves it into an own section (with an own title/term). Did you look at #48?\n\n3) Again I don't think this is a question of picking relationship type A or B and therefore for me it's also does not make sense to explain it terms of \"differences\". They are not the same things on the same level. You have the choice to either establish a formal relationship with us if there is a need and this document explains the formal/process requirements around it. Or you simply do nothing special and just work with the people you like to work with. While I understand that using the term \"informal relationship\" might be easier to understand for some people who are used to different liaison systems in different orgs, I don't think it actually reflects well how we work in the IETF. Especially in an RFC we should focus on the things that needs a formal specification and not constraint other things unnecessarily.\n\nAlso one more point, I think the purpose of this document is to specify the requirements/procedures for establishing formal relationships for us as a community. While of course people from other organisations might find and read this document, the intended use and audience is for the IETF community. And in my experience using RFC to communicate with other communities is not the best approach anyway. If we want to address the problem further, I think we need to further improve our documentation and communication in other places (like the webpage).\n\nActually one more point. RFC4052 doesn't even use the term \"formal relationship\". It only talks about \"liaison relationships\". We added the word formal everywhere in 4052bis to underline the point that you don't need to automatically take the formal steps that the documents describes to establish a \"liaison relationship\" in order to work with us. Maybe that was more confusing than helpful? Or what do you think?\n\n",

I would make the document be educational in the best ways for all entities to engage with the IETF.  I disagree that  \"the intended use and audience is for the IETF community\" internal use, since I know we've pointed people at that have come to the IETF to learn how to better engage with us (and the discussions that have occurred in the hallways and in the LC lunch hours).  I don't think any RFC should really only be for internal use -- we write them for the world at large to read and understand, including the ones that describe our internal processes.\n\nIn the end, you absolutely can try to craft the document so \"the purpose of this document is to specify the requirements/procedures for establishing formal relationships for us as a community\" and only describe the formal relationship, but to me that does a disservice to the reader that needs a more complete education about our methods for working with and engage with other SDOs.  Whether \"formal\" and \"informal\" are good terms or not certainly is a valid question, but to me the bigger question is how fully the document is going to describe the situation.

Suresh merged your (Wes') PR which was intended to be editorial, but introducing the concept of an informal relationship as your PR did, is to me more than just editorial. My PR intended to keep your editorial improvements but un-do the conceptional and scope change. This issue is there to continue the discussion and when we come to any agreement, we can work on a new PR.  But changing this of part of an editorial pass, didn't seem appropriate that's why we merged my PR.\n\nIf you think it would be useful to have PR alongside this discussion, feel free to create a new PR with (just) this change.",

      "body": "4052 describes the process to manage and handle liaison relationships. This kind of relationship, that the doc is scope to, is focused on those relationships where the IAB appoints a liaison manager. In the bis document we add the term \"formal\" in most places to make it more clear that this process that is described has this more formal step where the IAB decides to appoint a manager. (however, if adding the term formal creates more confusion that clarity, we could also reconsider it; but I still feel it helps.)\n\nI personally think the scope of the bis document should stay focused on this (formal) part of the process. Any more informal collaboration should also be well described somewhere to make it easier for people to understand the IETF approach, but an RFC should be focused on what needs to specified about any formal procedures and not go beyond that when it is not needed. For me that is a lesson learnt from many process RFCs to really focus in the formal parts that need tight specifications and not more.\n\nIf we would want to say about our general approach to liaison management or collaboration more generally, maybe that could be another informal RFC or, I think, having clear documentation on the website is even better because I would assume that's where people will look first. But I don't think we need to tie these consideration in the IETF-wide consensus document. In liaison management there is a need for some flexibility as every organization works differently and therefore I strongly argue to limit the BCP to guidelines for the IAB when to appoint a manager and (internal) instructions to liaison managers.",

For the IETF, creating a liaison relationship implies that we appoint a liaison manager and maybe we should say that somewhere in the document explicitly (if not already notes somewhere). However, what the process of the other SDO is, is not in our hands. An SDO could also e.g. decide to not have an explicit liaison or handle all formal liaisons through a central role. For example I think we don't have a counter part in ISO and our liaison manager would probably handle both incoming and outgoing liaisons.\r\n\r\nAlso note that this change to not address issue #9.
